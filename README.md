Case Study: Building an E-commerce Platform with React and Laravel API

Background: You are a software engineer working for a company that specializes in e-commerce
solutions. The company has decided to develop a new e-commerce platform called BetaMart to
streamline the process of buying and selling products online. The platform will consist of a front-end
application built with React and a back-end API developed with Laravel to handle data management and
business logic.

Objective: The objective of this project is to create a functional e-commerce platform where users can
browse products, add items to their cart, view their cart, remove items from their cart, and complete the
checkout process.

Requirements:
1. Front-End Application (React):

▪ Implement a user-friendly interface using React to allow users to interact with the e-
commerce platform.

▪ Display a list of available products fetched from the Laravel API.

▪ Allow users to add items to their shopping cart.

▪ Provide a cart view where users can see the items in their cart along with the quantity
and total price.

▪ Allow users to remove items from their cart.

▪ Implement a checkout process where users can enter their shipping details and complete
the purchase.

2. Back-End API (Laravel):
▪ Develop a RESTful API using Laravel to handle requests from the front-end application.

▪ Implement endpoints to fetch product data from the database and send it to the front end.

▪ Create endpoints to manage the shopping cart, including adding items, removing items,
and updating quantities.

▪ Implement functionality to calculate the total price of the items in the cart.

Solution Approach:
1. Front-End Development (React):

▪ Create React components for different sections of the e-commerce platform, such as
product listing, cart view, and checkout.

▪ Use React Router to handle navigation between different pages of the application.

▪ Implement state management using React Hooks to manage the state of the shopping
cart and user interactions.

▪ Use Fetch API to make HTTP requests to the Laravel API and fetch data.

▪ Design the user interface to be responsive and accessible across various devices and
screen sizes.

2. Back-End Development (Laravel):

▪ Set up a Laravel project with appropriate database configurations.

▪ Define models and migrations to represent products, users, and carts in the database.

▪ Implement controllers to handle incoming requests from the front end and perform
necessary operations, such as fetching product data and managing the shopping cart.

▪ Use Laravel's validation features to validate incoming requests and ensure data integrity.

▪ Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the API endpoints and
restrict access to authenticated users only.

▪ Utilize Laravel's built-in features for handling sessions and managing user authentication.
